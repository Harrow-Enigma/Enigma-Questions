## Overview

A series of computational problems by Team Enigma.
This contains the code for the website.

## Self-Host and Develop

I'm using Nuxt.js on Netlify for this application.
You'll need knowledge of Vue.js to understand the codebase

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
